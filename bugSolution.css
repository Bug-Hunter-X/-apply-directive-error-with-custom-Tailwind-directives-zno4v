The correct approach is to directly include the custom styles within your component styles, instead of using `@apply` with a custom directive:

```css
/* Correct usage: */
@layer components {
  .my-component {
    color: red; /* Directly apply the styles */
  }
}
/* Or remove custom directive completely if not needed */
```
